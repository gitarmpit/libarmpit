Cortex M3:
sleep mode stops the processor clock
deep sleep mode stops the system clock and switches off the PLL and flash memory.

SLEEPDEEP bit of the SCR selects which sleep mode is used


WFI : wait for interrupt 
WFE : wait for event 

The Wait For Event instruction, WFE, causes entry to sleep mode depending on the value of a
one-bit event register. When the processor executes a WFE instruction, it checks the value of the
event register:
0 The processor stops executing instructions and enters sleep mode.
1 The processor clears the register to 0 and continues executing instructions without
entering sleep mode.


SLEEPONEXIT:

If the SLEEPONEXIT bit of the SCR is set to 1, when the processor completes the execution of
all exception handlers it returns to Thread mode and immediately enters sleep mode. Use this
mechanism in applications that only require the processor to run when an exception occurs

SCR 

[2] SLEEPDEEP   0 = sleep, 1 = deep sleep 

[1] SLEEPONEXIT  0 = do not sleep when returning to Thread mode
                 1 = enter sleep, or deep sleep, on return from an ISR

Setting this bit to 1 enables an interrupt driven application to avoid returning to an empty
main application. 


================================
Sleep, Stop, Standby 

Sleep mode (CPU clock off, all peripherals including Cortex®-M3 core peripherals like
NVIC, SysTick, etc. are kept running) Voltage regulator on

Sleep (Sleep now or Sleep-on -exit)  
enter: WFI or WFE   
Wake up: any interrupt (WFI) or wakeup event (WFE)  

-------------------
Stop:  All 1.8V domain clocks OFF, HSI HSE off,  Vreg: On or in low power mode   

Enter: PDDS and LPDS bits + SLEEPDEEP bit + WFI or WFE      
Wakeup: Any EXTI line (configured in the  EXTI registers)
-------------------
Standby 
All 1.8V domain  clocks OFF, HSI HSE off, Vreg OFF 

Enter:  PDDS bit + SLEEPDEEP bit +  WFI or WFE 
Wakeup: WKUP pin rising edge, RTC alarm, external reset in NRST pin, IWDG reset
